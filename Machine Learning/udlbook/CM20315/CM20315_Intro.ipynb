You won't learn it by just listening to lectures or reading books.  It really helps to interact with it and explore yourself. <br><br> Work through the cells below, running each cell in turn.  In various places you will see the words **\"TO DO\"**. Follow the instructions at these places.  If you can't figure out what is going on or how to complete the section, feel free to ask your fellow students or the TAs in the practical session or via Moodle.  This does not count toward your final marks, but complete=ing it will help you do well in your coursework and exam and reduce your stress levels later on.\n"
