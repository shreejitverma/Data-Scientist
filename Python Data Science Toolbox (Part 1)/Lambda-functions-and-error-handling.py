# Writing a lambda function you already know
# Some function definitions are simple enough that they can be converted to a lambda function. By doing this, you write less lines of code, which is pretty awesome and will come in handy, especially when you're writing and maintaining big programs. In this exercise, you will use what you know about lambda functions to convert a function that does a simple task into a lambda function. Take a look at this function definition:


# def echo_word(word1, echo):
#     """Concatenate echo copies of word1."""
#     words = word1 * echo
#     return words


# The function echo_word takes 2 parameters: a string value, word1 and an integer value, echo. It returns a string that is a concatenation of echo copies of word1. Your task is to convert this simple function into a lambda function.
# Define echo_word as a lambda function: echo_word
from functools import reduce
echo_word = (lambda word1, echo: word1*echo)

# Call echo_word: result
result = echo_word('hey', 5)

# Print result
print(result)

# Map() and lambda functions
# So far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as well as to redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function.

# Recall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:

# nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)
# You can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.

# Create a list of strings: spells
spells = ["protego", "accio", "expecto patronum", "legilimens"]

# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells
shout_spells = map(lambda item: item+'!!!', spells)

# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list
shout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)

# Print the result
print(shout_spells_list)

# Filter() and lambda functions
# In the previous exercise, you used lambda functions to anonymously embed an operation within map(). You will practice this again in this exercise by using a lambda function with filter(), which may be new to you! The function filter() offers a way to filter out elements from a list that don't satisfy certain criteria.

# Your goal in this exercise is to use filter() to create, from an input list of strings, a new list that contains only strings that have more than 6 characters.
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'pippin',
              'aragorn', 'boromir', 'legolas', 'gimli', 'gandalf']

# Use filter() to apply a lambda function over fellowship: result
result = filter(lambda member: len(member) > 6, fellowship)

# Convert result to a list: result_list
result_list = list(result)

# Print result_list
print(result_list)

# Reduce() and lambda functions
# You're getting very good at using lambda functions! Here's one more function to add to your repertoire of skills. The reduce() function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike map() and filter(), returns a single value as a result. To use reduce(), you must import it from the functools module.

# Remember gibberish() from a few exercises back?

# # Define gibberish


# def gibberish(*args):
#     """Concatenate strings in *args together."""
#     hodgepodge = ''
#     for word in args:
#         hodgepodge += word
#     return hodgepodge


# gibberish() simply takes a list of strings as an argument and returns, as a single-value result, the concatenation of all of these strings. In this exercise, you will replicate this functionality by using reduce() and a lambda function that concatenates strings together.
# Import reduce from functools

# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'brandon', 'rickon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
result = reduce(lambda item1, item2: item1+item2, stark)

# Print the result
print(result)

# Error handling with try-except
# A good practice in writing your own functions is also anticipating the ways in which other people ( or yourself, if you accidentally misuse your own function) might use the function you defined.

# As in the previous exercise, you saw that the len() function is able to handle input arguments such as strings, lists, and tuples, but not int type ones and raises an appropriate error and error message when it encounters invalid input arguments. One way of doing this is through exception handling with the try-except block.

# In this exercise, you will define a function as well as use a try-except block for handling cases when incorrect input arguments are passed to the function.

# Recall the shout_echo() function you defined in previous exercises
# parts of the function definition are provided in the sample code. Your goal is to complete the exception handling code in the function definition and provide an appropriate error message when raising an error.
# Define shout_echo


def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Initialize empty strings: echo_word, shout_words
    echo_word = ''
    shout_words = ''

    # Add exception handling with try-except
    try:
        # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
        echo_word = word1*echo

        # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_words
        shout_words = echo_word + '!!!'
    except:
        # Print error message
        print("word1 must be a string and echo must be an integer.")

    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words


# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo="accelerator")

# Error handling by raising an error
# Another way to raise an error is by using raise. In this exercise, you will add a raise statement to the shout_echo() function you defined before to raise an error message when the value supplied by the user to the echo argument is less than 0.

# The call to shout_echo() uses valid argument values. To test and see how the raise statement works, simply change the value for the echo argument to a negative value. Don't forget to change it back to valid values to move on to the next exercise!
# Define shout_echo


def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Raise an error with raise
    if echo < 0:
        raise ValueError('echo must be greater than or equal to 0')

    # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
    echo_word = word1 * echo

    # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_word
    shout_word = echo_word + '!!!'

    # Return shout_word
    return shout_word


# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo=5)


# Bringing it all together(1)
# This is awesome! You have now learned how to write anonymous functions using lambda, how to pass lambda functions as arguments to other functions such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), as well as how to write errors and output custom error messages within your functions. You will now put together these learnings to good use by working with a Twitter dataset. Before practicing your new error handling skills, in this exercise, you will write a lambda function and use filter() to select retweets, that is, tweets that begin with the string 'RT'.

# To help you accomplish this, the Twitter data has been imported into the DataFrame, tweets_df. Go for it!

# Select retweets from the Twitter DataFrame: result
result = filter(lambda x: x[0:2] == 'RT', tweets_df['text'])

# Create list from filter object result: res_list
res_list = list(result)

# Print all retweets in res_list
for tweet in res_list:
    print(tweet)
# Bringing it all together(2)
# Sometimes, we make mistakes when calling functions - even ones you made yourself. But don't fret! In this exercise, you will improve on your previous work with the count_entries() function in the last chapter by adding a try-except block to it. This will allow your function to provide a helpful message when the user calls your count_entries() function but provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.

# Once again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.
# Define count_entries()


def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}

    # Add try block
    try:
        # Extract column from DataFrame: col
        col = df[col_name]

        # Iterate over the column in dataframe
        for entry in col:

            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
            if entry in cols_count.keys():
                cols_count[entry] += 1
            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
            else:
                cols_count[entry] = 1

        # Return the cols_count dictionary
        return cols_count

    # Add except block
    except:
        print('The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.')


# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print result1
print(result1)

# Bringing it all together(3)
# In the previous exercise, you built on your function count_entries() to add a try-except block. This was so that users would get helpful messages when calling your count_entries() function and providing a column name that isn't in the DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll instead raise a ValueError in the case that the user provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.

# Once again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.

# Define count_entries()
# Define count_entries1()

def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Raise a ValueError if col_name is NOT in DataFrame
    if col_name not in df.columns:
        raise ValueError('The DataFrame does not have a ' +
                         col_name + ' column.')

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}

    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]

    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
        if entry in cols_count.keys():
            cols_count[entry] += 1
            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            cols_count[entry] = 1

        # Return the cols_count dictionary
    return cols_count


# Call count_entries(): result1
